HI Humans!


Jackie Chan here,I like Rubic's Cube and I can finish a 2-2-2 Cube with no more than 10 seconds.
And I also like mathmatics ,as I know little of it and I wanna to know more ,because it is wonderful!

I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

#incldue <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
